# Monkeyarch Configuration
# Copy this file to config.toml and adjust as needed

# Root directory for file operations (MUST be an absolute path)
# All file operations are restricted to this directory.
#
# Examples:
#   root_directory = "/home/pi/media"           # Local folder
#   root_directory = "/media/pi/SDCARD"         # External SD card (auto-mounted)
#   root_directory = "/mnt/usb"                 # USB drive (manual mount)
#
# The directory must exist before starting the server.
# For external storage, ensure it's mounted before starting monkeyarch.
root_directory = "/home/pi/media"

# Network binding
bind_address = "0.0.0.0"
port = 8000

# Maximum upload size in bytes (100 MB default)
max_upload_size = 104857600

# Enable/disable delete operations
enable_delete = true

# External static files directory (optional)
# If set, serves frontend from this directory instead of embedded files.
# Useful for development - edit HTML/CSS/JS without recompiling.
# If not set or directory doesn't exist, uses embedded assets.
#
# static_directory = "/path/to/frontend"
